INSTRUCTIONS  how to assign each segment of the audio to its corresponding word from the lyrics with the software tool Praat:

Songs are divided into sections, so work we with the audio for a given section (chorus/verse).
The corresponding lyrics can be found in .pdf files on the given file lyrics.txt    

We generate files with extension .TextGrid: with tier named *words*
